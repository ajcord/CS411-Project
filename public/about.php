        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>ClassMaster is a unique application that predicts the likelihood of successfully enrolling in a class at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. ClassMaster was developed by four students attending UIUC as a class project. Our application employs the use of statistical algorithms to best predict one's probability of enrollment.</p>
        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <p> As more data becomes available we plan to improve and further develop the statistical algorithms currently in place. These improvements will allow users to more accurately gauge enrollment probabilities.</p>
